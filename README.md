# Express Typescript MongoDB Boilerplate

A boilerplate which has user authentication with jwt and more:

- Framework: [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- Language: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- Object Modelling: [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- Authentication mechanism: [JWT](https://jwt.io/)
- Password Hashing: [Bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js)
- Logging: [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)
- Validation: [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)

## Getting Started

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Add environment variables to .env, check .env.example for reference.
- Run `npm run dev` to run server in development mode.

## Why did I do this?

To get familiar with typescript, create a reusable template for my future projects (feel free to use it ;\)) and because It had been a while since I touched backend development, it was fun.

## Is this complete?

Nope, I'll make it even more fancy when I learn more and have time

## Any suggestions or improvements?

Feel free to create an issue or PR.
